If you're reading this, you probably share my fascination with the Cloud Native world. When I learned about the CNCF's Kubestronaut program, I took it as an interesting challenge, an objective way to measure what level I really was at with Kubernetes. It was the perfect opportunity to test my knowledge and see how far I could go in this fascinating ecosystem. And while I was in the middle of preparation, the CNCF announced the new Golden Kubestronaut program, adding an even more ambitious goal to my horizon.

I'm still in the middle of this journey. I've spent many nights studying, I've talked with professionals who already have their jacket, and I've passed several of those exams. If there's one thing I've learned in this process, it's that each certification represents a significant challenge, but the satisfaction of passing is worth it.

Let me share what this adventure has been like from my personal perspective.

## The Starting Point: Becoming a Kubestronaut

Everything starts with an ambitious but achievable goal. To earn the Kubestronaut title, you must demonstrate comprehensive mastery of Kubernetes by passing five certifications that cover the fundamental aspects of this technology.

### The Five Required Certifications

To achieve Kubestronaut status, you need to pass these five exams:

**Theoretical exams** (multiple choice, no access to documentation):

- **KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate)**: The theoretical foundations of the entire Cloud Native ecosystem
- **KCSA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Security Associate)**: A deep dive into cloud security principles

**Practical exams** (with access to official documentation):

- **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)**: Validates your ability to keep a cluster running regardless of obstacles
- **CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)**: Focused on efficient application deployment and management
- **CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)**: The most challenging, where security takes center stage

### My Personal Recommendation: Order Matters

After my experience and conversations with several Kubestronauts, I'll share the order I consider most effective for tackling these certifications:

1. **KCNA** - Start with the theoretical foundations of the ecosystem
2. **KCSA** - Deepen your understanding of security concepts
3. **CKA** - Your first practical exam, establishing administrative foundations
4. **CKAD** - Build on what you've learned, now from the developer's perspective
5. **CKS** - Kubernetes security specialization, requires having passed the CKA

Why this order? Starting with the theoretical part gives you a solid understanding of the ecosystem before facing the terminal. The KCNA and KCSA exams will give you the context and vocabulary needed to better leverage documentation during practical exams. Additionally, the CKS requires having previously passed the CKA, so it makes sense to save it for last when you've already mastered both theory and practice.

### The Reward

When you finally pass all five certifications and keep them valid simultaneously, the moment of truth arrives. The rewards go beyond recognition: you receive the exclusive Kubestronaut jacket (definitely a nice trophy), your verifiable digital badge, access to a private Slack community where you exchange knowledge with other experts, and discounts to continue your training.

## The Next Level: Golden Kubestronaut

Reaching Kubestronaut level is just the beginning. For those who want to go further, there's the Golden Kubestronaut — a level for those who not only master Kubernetes but know in depth much of the Cloud Native ecosystem recognized by the CNCF.

### A Journey Through the Ecosystem

The list of required certifications expands considerably. In addition to maintaining the five Kubestronaut certifications, you must conquer the following:

**LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin)**: The journey begins by establishing a solid Linux foundation. It's a pure practical exam, where you only have the terminal and your knowledge.

From there, you dive into an ocean of specialized tools. Most are theoretical exams that test your deep understanding:

- **PCA**: Prometheus for monitoring and alerting. Tests you on metrics, PromQL queries, and observability best practices.
- **CCA**: Cilium for advanced networking and security. Covers eBPF, network policies, and traffic observability.
- **CAPA**: Argo Project, focused on ArgoCD for GitOps, Argo Workflows for orchestration, and other tools in the Argo ecosystem.
- **CGOA**: GitOps as a methodology. Principles, patterns, and best practices for declarative continuous delivery.
- **CBA**: Backstage for developer portals. Building service catalogs and internal developer experiences.
- **OTCA**: OpenTelemetry for unified observability. Distributed traces, metrics, and logs in an open standard.
- **KCA**: Kyverno for declarative policies. Validation, mutation, and generation of Kubernetes resources.

Special mention goes to **ICA (Istio Certified Associate)**, which combines theoretical questions with a practical lab. It forces you to switch focus mid-exam, which is quite unique.

### Additional Benefits

Achieving Golden Kubestronaut status brings additional benefits: a golden backpack, a limited edition beanie, wellness platform subscriptions, one free annual entry to any Kubernetes Community Day, and discounts for KubeCon and future certifications. It's an important recognition of your dedication and knowledge.

## Lessons From the Trenches

Although I still need to pass the CKS, ICA, CCA, CBA, and LFCS to complete my path to Golden Kubestronaut, I want to share what I've learned so far and what fellow adventurers have told me.

Each exam has its own personality. The CKA and CKAD taught me a lot about Kubernetes administration and development. According to those who've already passed the CKS, that's where security takes center stage with complex scenarios. And the LFCS, I'm told, is a return to Linux system administration basics, where you only have the terminal as a tool. Each passed certification gives you energy to continue, although there are moments where fatigue and doubts appear.

### Tips That Make a Difference

These are some strategies that have worked for me and that other Kubestronauts also recommend:

**Commitment with deadline**: When you buy a voucher, schedule the exam immediately. Having a date on the calendar forces you to study seriously. The pressure of a deadline really works.

**Master documentation navigation**: In practical exams (CKA, CKAD, CKS), knowing how to search quickly in official documentation is as important as knowing the commands. Practice until you can find anything in seconds.

**Preparation for theoretical exams**: No shortcuts. Make summaries and review until the concepts are clear.

**Practice is key**: Set up your own cluster with minikube or kind, use the killer.sh practice sessions (they come with CKA/CKAD/CKS/LFCS), and practice until kubectl becomes natural to you.

**Join the community**: CNCF local study groups ([https://community.cncf.io/chapters/](https://community.cncf.io/chapters/)) are great support. Sharing experiences and questions with others on the same path makes all the difference.

**Invest in good resources**: Platforms like KodeKloud offer specialized labs and courses. Although they're paid, the investment is worth it for the quality of content and practice you get.

**Look for certification discounts**: Certifications have a considerable cost, but there are always ways to save. The repository [https://github.com/techiescamp/linux-foundation-coupon](https://github.com/techiescamp/linux-foundation-coupon) maintains active coupons each month. The best time to buy is usually Black Friday.

## The Mission Continues...

The path to Golden Kubestronaut is arduous and demanding, but I can assure you that every hour invested transforms you deeply as a professional. Beyond the badges or exclusive clothing, it's a tangible demonstration of your commitment to excellence and an invaluable opportunity to grow and share knowledge with the community.

My journey continues, celebrating every achievement, no matter how small. If you've also embarked on this route, my advice is simple: persevere. Set your next goal, study with passion, and celebrate every progress.

I hope to meet you soon in the exclusive golden club!
